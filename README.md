Instagram Clone
This project is a full-stack Instagram clone developed using Java, Spring Boot, JWT for authentication, Redux for state management, and MySQL for the database. It replicates core Instagram features such as user registration, login, posting images, liking and commenting on posts, and following/unfollowing other users. The backend is powered by Java and Spring Boot, providing secure authentication with JWT and interacting with a MySQL database. The frontend uses React.js and Redux to manage the application state, ensuring a responsive and smooth user experience.
